1. Place boards at least 5mm apart so that a 1mm router can cut them out with plenty of clearance.
2. Place 4 or more holes around each board (.059‚Äù diameter) to be used as fiducials. Don't place them too close to the edge, otherwise they may be covered by tape during the depanelization milling procedure.
3. Each board will be cut out individually and be mindful of the max board size.
