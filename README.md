## Circuit Board Versioning Scheme
* New boards must start their numbering at revision 1.
* Revision numbers must be incremented by 1 when a physical board is manufactured, but not at any other time.
* After a board is manufactured, the files corresponding to the manufactured version should not be modified.
* Circuit boards based off of a previous year's design should increment based off of the previous board's revision number.
